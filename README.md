# Cosmic ant simulator

This project aims to simulate theoretical ants with ability to fly/move in three dimensions while also reacting to pheromones etc.

This readme is going to get larger as the time passes:
* [ ] to do list of ant/simulation features will be showcased
* [x] it will include a little dev-log/update notes on each major update
* [ ] it will describe the rules of the simulation and behavior of ants and their different castes in depths
* [ ] some gif/s from simulation
* [ ] manual for running the simulation


## Update notes
This is a skeleton code of the project. A lot of work before me. Rust has been chosen for implementation since it has full opengl wrapper and I wanted to learn rust anyway since some time.
